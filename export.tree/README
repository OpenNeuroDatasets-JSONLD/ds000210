A multi-echo replication sample of autobiographical memory, prospection and theory of mind reasoning tasks  published in Spreng and Grady (J Cogn. Neurosci. 22, 1112-1123, 2010). 


Four task runs and one resting-state run were collected for 31 young adults. Full acquisition parameters are detailed in the accompanying Data Descriptor published at Scientific Data, but are summarized here for ease of use:


T1w:
one 5m25s run 
repetition time (TR) = 2530 ms 
echo time (TE) = 3.4 ms
inversion time = 1100 ms 
flip angle (FA) = 7° 
1.0 mm isotropic voxels 
176 slices 


Task:
four 8m40s runs
repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms 
echo time (TE) = 13, 27, and 43 ms 
flip angle (FA) = 77° 
matrix size = 64 x 64 
field of view (FOV) = 240 mm
slice thickness 3.8 mm 
33 axial slices 


Rest:
one 10m06s run
repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms 
echo time (TE) = 13.7, 30, and 47 ms 
flip angle (FA) = 83° 
matrix size = 72 x 72 
field of view (FOV) = 210 mm 
3.0 mm isotropic voxels
46 axial slices
